💡 Inspiration
Revenge Travelling is a case where people travel due to not being able to travel before (in this case due to coronavirus) This can lead to a wave of new cases which we must avoid. Keeping everyone's will to travel and coronavirus in mind, we came up with a very simple solution

⚙What it does
The cross platform app (works on both IOS and Android) collects and shows nearby, or selected location conditions whether they are safe to travel or not.
In case user finds a location which is not in the database, they can contribute to add the locations with the reason why its safe/unsafe to travel there.
The app can show nearby locations or chosen locations
🛠How we built it
We wanted to challenge ourselves so we used flutter for the first time along with cockroach db. although we were able to make database work only locally which is still a big achievement for us..

💪Challenges we ran into
Only one of the team member had experience with flutter and dart, so the biggest challenge was to learn a new framework, language and use it in coordination to create a cross platform app
📌Accomplishments that we're proud of
To be able to make a working app with a database was a big achievement for us within 48 hours
📚 What we learned
There's plenty of new OOP and familiarity in app programming which we learned along the way
⏭What's next for SafeVoyage
Integration of database with cloud cluster
Auto Capturing location using Google Maps api (Exact coordinates)
Lots of UI improvements
Data verification when contributed by users
